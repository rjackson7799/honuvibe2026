## About Page Redesign — Brand-First, Founder-Second

### Problem
- Old About page led with Ryan Jackson's photo and personal bio — read as a founder bio, not a brand page
- No mention of core competencies, consulting services, or operating values
- Hero was a 2-column photo + name layout, visually inconsistent with other sub-page heroes

### New Page Structure (6 sections)
- [x] **Hero** — HonuHub-style centered hero with gradient background (`from-accent-teal/10 via-bg-primary to-accent-gold/5`), glow orbs, `min-h-[70vh]`, "A Whole New Vibe for AI" headline
- [x] **Mission & Vision** — 2-card layout (teal accent = mission, gold accent = vision) with SectionHeading intro
- [x] **Aloha Standard** — 4-card grid of operating principles (Give Generously, Pro-Bono Is Real Work, Celebrate the Community, Never Fear-Based) with left accent bars and icons
- [x] **Core Competencies + Consulting CTA** — 4-card grid (AI Prototyping, Micro-SaaS Design, AI Integration, AI Education) + gold "Get in Touch" CTA → `/contact`
- [x] **Founder** — Ryan Jackson bio moved down, condensed to 2 paragraphs, photo placeholder, h2 (not h1)
- [x] **Social** — Unchanged (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)

### i18n
- [x] Full EN + JP translations for all 6 sections (`about_page` namespace restructured)

### Files Created
- `components/sections/about/about-mission.tsx`
- `components/sections/about/about-aloha-standard.tsx`
- `components/sections/about/about-competencies.tsx`
- `components/sections/about/about-founder.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `components/sections/about/about-hero.tsx` (complete rewrite — HonuHub-style centered hero)
- `components/sections/about/index.ts` (updated barrel exports)
- `app/[locale]/about/page.tsx` (new section imports and order)
- `messages/en.json`, `messages/ja.json` (`about_page` namespace replaced)

### Files Deleted
- `components/sections/about/about-story.tsx` (replaced by about-mission)
- `components/sections/about/about-philosophy.tsx` (replaced by about-aloha-standard)
- `components/sections/about/about-work.tsx` (replaced by about-competencies)

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript: zero errors
- [x] Production build: clean, `/en/about` and `/ja/about` in output

## Exploration Page — Dual Featured Builds

### Problem
- Single featured project (KwameBrathwaite.com) didn't showcase the full range of our work
- Only one territory represented (arts/culture web redesign)

### Changes
- [x] Refactored `FeaturedBuild` from single 2-column layout to **2-card side-by-side grid**
- [x] Extracted `FeaturedCard` sub-component with independent carousel state per card
- [x] Data-driven via `ProjectConfig[]` array — easy to add/remove projects
- [x] Translation key restructured: `featured_build` → `featured_builds` with `kwame` + `hci` project keys
- [x] Section-level heading added above both cards ("Featured Builds" / "注目プロジェクト")

### Projects
1. **KwameBrathwaite.com** — Photography archive redesign (status: "In Development", pulsing dot)
2. **HCI Medical Group** — Healthcare platform + custom project management module (status: "Live", solid dot)

### Layout
- Desktop: `md:grid-cols-2` side-by-side cards
- Mobile: stacked vertically
- Each card: carousel on top → project details below (vertical stack fits 50% width)
- Cards have border + subtle background for visual separation

### Files Created
- `public/projects/hci-medical/screenshot-1.svg`, `screenshot-2.svg`, `screenshot-3.svg` (placeholders)

### Files Modified
- `components/sections/exploration/featured-build.tsx` (full refactor)
- `messages/en.json` (`featured_build` → `featured_builds` + HCI content)
- `messages/ja.json` (`featured_build` → `featured_builds` + HCI JP content)

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript: zero errors
- [x] Production build: clean
- [ ] Replace placeholder SVGs with real HCI Medical Group screenshots

## Hybrid Light Mode (Proton Mail Style)

### Approach
Dark-mode-first brand anchors (nav, hero, newsletter CTA, footer) stay dark in both themes. Content sections between them flip to light backgrounds in light mode, inspired by Proton Mail's dark header + light content pattern.

### Page Rhythm in Light Mode
```
Dark:  Nav → Hero
Light: MissionStrip → HonuHubFeature → FeaturedCourses
Light: ExplorationPreview → RyanBioStrip
Dark:  NewsletterSignup (branded CTA band)
Light: SocialProof
Dark:  Footer
```

### Implementation
- [x] `.dark-zone` CSS scope in `styles/globals.css` — forces all CSS variables to dark-mode values inside `.dark-zone` when `[data-theme="light"]` is active
- [x] `.light-zone-fade` CSS — gradient bridge for smooth dark→light transition after hero
- [x] Nav (`components/layout/nav-client.tsx`) — always dark via `dark-zone` class
- [x] Hero (`components/sections/hero-section.tsx`) — always dark via `dark-zone` class
- [x] Footer (`components/layout/footer.tsx`) — always dark via `dark-zone bg-bg-primary`
- [x] Newsletter signup (`components/sections/newsletter-signup.tsx`) — always dark via `dark-zone bg-[#080c18]`
- [x] Mobile menu (`components/layout/mobile-menu.tsx`) — always dark via `dark-zone` class
- [x] Homepage glow dividers (`app/[locale]/page.tsx`) — wrapped in `dark-zone` containers
- [x] MissionStrip wrapped in `light-zone-fade` for smooth hero→content transition

### Files Modified
- `styles/globals.css` (`.dark-zone` variable overrides + `.light-zone-fade` gradient)
- `components/layout/nav-client.tsx`
- `components/sections/hero-section.tsx`
- `components/layout/footer.tsx`
- `components/sections/newsletter-signup.tsx`
- `components/layout/mobile-menu.tsx`
- `app/[locale]/page.tsx`

### Verification
- [x] Production build: clean
- [~] Visual QA: dark mode unchanged, light mode shows dark anchors + light content zones

## AI Course Image Generation — Prompt Rewrite

### Problem
- Old prompt forced "completely abstract — no recognizable objects" + rigid brand hex palette
- Every course thumbnail looked the same regardless of topic
- `deriveVisualMotifs()` keyword lookup missed most courses (e.g., chatbot course matched zero keywords)

### Changes
- [x] Removed `deriveVisualMotifs()` — replaced by passing course title + description directly to Gemini
- [x] Renamed `getLevelComplexity()` → `getLevelMood()` — outputs visual mood ("approachable"/"professional"/"sophisticated") instead of abstract shape density
- [x] Added `getDescriptionSnippet()` — first two sentences of description (capped at 250 chars) for richer topic context
- [x] Rewrote `buildImagePrompt()` — topic-first prompt: "Create a high-quality background image for an online course about: {title}: {description}"
- [x] Removed abstract-only constraint — representational visual metaphors now welcome
- [x] Brand colors changed from forced hex values to soft preference ("dark backgrounds, teal/gold welcome if they suit")
- [x] Kept no-text constraint and thumbnail vs hero composition guidance

### Files Modified
- `app/api/admin/courses/generate-image/route.ts` (prompt rewrite)

---

## i18n Provider Fix

### Problem
- Clicking "Japanese" navigated to `/ja` but page content stayed in English
- `NextIntlClientProvider` had no explicit `locale`/`messages` props — relied on implicit server context propagation

### Changes
- [x] `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` — Added `getMessages()` call, passed explicit `locale` and `messages` props to `NextIntlClientProvider`
- [x] `components/layout/nav-client.tsx` — Fixed `usePathname` import from `next/navigation` → `@/i18n/navigation` (consistent with `lang-toggle.tsx`)

---

- Next.js 16.1.6 (Turbopack) + React 19.2.3
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS v4 (inline @theme tokens)
- next-intl 4.8.3 (URL-based locale routing)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS + Storage)
- Claude API (course markdown parser — claude-sonnet-4, ESL content generator — claude-sonnet-4)
- OpenAI TTS API (ESL pronunciation audio — tts-1, nova voice)
- Google Gemini API (course image generation — gemini-3-pro-image-preview)
- Lucide React icons

### Architecture
- **Server Components** for data fetching (catalog, detail, dashboard, admin pages)
- **Server Actions** for mutations (enrollment, course CRUD, admin actions)
- **API Routes** only for external integrations (Claude API, Stripe, OAuth callback)
- **Client Components** only for interactivity (forms, accordions, tabs, buttons with state)

### Blocked Items
- Blog (need CMS decision: Sanity.io vs Payload)
- Real Stripe payments (skeleton ready, need Stripe account)
- Vercel deployment (need domain + org setup)
- Plausible analytics (need account setup)
- Claude API parsing (need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var)

## Floating Tech Showcase (Reusable Pattern)

### Effect
Organic floating icon layout with underwater theme — icons bob with staggered framer-motion animations, appear dimmed by default, and glow on hover with brand color + drop-shadow. An auto-illuminate cycle randomly highlights one icon every 3 seconds, pausing when user hovers.

### Key Behaviors
- **Bobbing**: framer-motion `animate={{ y: [0, -12, 0] }}` with staggered durations (3.5–5.5s) and delays per icon
- **Dimmed default**: `text-fg-secondary/50` — visible but muted
- **Hover glow**: full brand color + `drop-shadow(0 0 20px <color>)` + blurred glow circle behind icon
- **Dim siblings**: `group/container` pattern — `group-hover/container:opacity-20` with `hover:!opacity-100`
- **Auto-illuminate**: `useState`/`setInterval` picks random icon every 3s, applies glow; pauses on container hover
- **Labels**: hidden by default, fade in below icon on hover/auto-illuminate
- **Accessibility**: `useReducedMotion` disables all animation + auto-illuminate
- **Deep water gradient**: `bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent via-bg-primary/80 to-bg-primary` overlay

### Files
- `components/sections/exploration/tech-stack-showcase.tsx` — main component (currently Exploration-specific)
- `components/sections/exploration/tech-icon.tsx` — 12 SVG icons using `currentColor`

### Reuse Notes
To use this effect elsewhere (e.g., homepage, about page, course landing pages):
1. Extract floating layout + auto-illuminate logic into a generic `FloatingIconShowcase` component
2. Accept `items: { icon: ReactNode; color: string; label: string }[]` as props
3. Keep `TechIcon` for tech-specific usage, but the floating/glow pattern is icon-agnostic
4. The `scales`, `offsets`, `durations` arrays can be auto-generated based on item count

### Dependencies
- `framer-motion` (already installed — v12.34.3)

## Lighthouse Hero Background

### Effect
Cinematic Hawaiian night-sky scene behind the Exploration hero. Canvas-rendered starfield for performance, framer-motion beam sweep for the lighthouse, and layered SVG island silhouettes for depth.

### Layers (bottom to top)
1. **Base fill** — hardcoded `#02050f` (always nocturnal, ignores theme toggle)
2. **Sky gradient** — top 60%, three-stop navy gradient
3. **Star canvas** — 150 twinkling stars via `<canvas>` RAF loop (follows `ocean-canvas.tsx` pattern)
4. **Hokule'a star** — amber guiding star with subtle pulse animation
5. **Ocean gradient** — bottom 40%, dark gradient with SVG noise shimmer + teal horizon glow
6. **Island silhouettes** — 3 layered SVGs with smooth bezier curves: far rolling ridges, Diamond Head volcanic cone, Mokulua twin humps
7. **Lighthouse** — tower structure with sweeping 3D beam (`rotateY` + `rotateZ`, 12s cycle), inner bright beam, lens flare
8. **Vignette** — radial gradient darkening edges for cinematic focus

### Key Behaviors
- **Stars**: canvas RAF loop, each star oscillates alpha via `sin(frame * speed + phase)`
- **Beam sweep**: framer-motion `rotateY: [0, 60, 0]` with `perspective: 1000px` wrapper, `mix-blend-screen`
- **Lens flare**: pulsing blur circle synced to beam cycle
- **Reduced motion**: static stars at dim alpha, beam and flare hidden entirely
- **Hardcoded palette**: always dark — lighthouse scene is nocturnal regardless of theme

### Files
- `components/sections/exploration/lighthouse-background.tsx` — full component (canvas + motion.div)
- `components/sections/exploration/exploration-hero.tsx` — imports and renders `<LighthouseBackground />`

### Dependencies
- `framer-motion` (v12.34.3 — already installed)

## Build Page + Explore Page Restructure (2026-03-04)

### Rationale
The Exploration page was carrying two jobs: portfolio (social proof) and capabilities pitch (conversion). These serve different visitors at different stages, so they've been split into dedicated pages:
- **Explore** (`/explore`) — Pure portfolio: "Look at what they've built"
- **Build** (`/build`) — Capabilities + conversion: "Here's how they can build for me"

### Build Page Sections
1. **BuildHero** — Gradient background, "From Idea to Launch" headline, dual CTAs (Start a Project → #inquire, See Our Work → /explore)
2. **TerritoryCards** — 5 territory cards (Web, Database, SaaS, Automations, Pro-Bono) with accent colors and "See examples" links
3. **TechLogoGrid** — Grayscale tech logos with hover color reveal (migrated from Explore)
4. **BuildProcessTimeline** — 5-step timeline: Discovery → Blueprint → Build → Launch → Grow (horizontal desktop, vertical mobile)
5. **EngagementCards** — 3 cards: Project Build, Strategic AI Guidance, Nonprofit & Community
6. **ProofStrip** — 3 stats (20+ projects, 3 countries, 60% time saved)
7. **InquirySection** — Full ApplicationForm with source_page tracking (shared with /apply)
8. **AdvisoryLink** — Subtle link to /apply for strategic engagements

### Explore Page Changes
- **Removed**: TechStackShowcase, ProcessTimeline, TerritoryGrid, ExplorationCta (all moved to Build)
- **Removed**: ExplorationLeadForm modal from hero
- **Updated hero**: Dual CTAs — "Browse Projects" (scroll) + "Work With Us" (→ /build), lighthouse background kept
- **Added**: ExploreBottomCTA strip — "Inspired by what you see? Start a Project →" linking to /build
- **Added**: CategoryFilter component (pills: All, Web, Database, SaaS, Automations, Pro-Bono) — ready for project filtering

### Shared Infrastructure
- **ApplicationForm** (`components/forms/ApplicationForm.tsx`) — 10 fields, shared between /build and /apply, `sourcePage` prop tracks origin
- **CTAStrip** (`components/sections/CTAStrip.tsx`) — Reusable headline + CTA component
- **DB migration** (`009_application_source_page.sql`) — `source_page` column + `desired_outcome` column on applications table

### Navigation
Nav updated from 5 to 6 links: HonuHub, Explore, **Build**, Learn, About, Contact

### New File Count (Build Page + Explore Restructure)
- **8 build components** (`components/build/`)
- **1 form component** (`components/forms/ApplicationForm.tsx`)
- **1 page route** (`app/[locale]/build/page.tsx`)
- **1 CTA strip** (`components/sections/CTAStrip.tsx`)
- **1 explore CTA** (`components/sections/exploration/explore-bottom-cta.tsx`)
- **1 category filter** (`components/exploration/CategoryFilter.tsx`)
- **1 SQL migration** (`supabase/migrations/009_application_source_page.sql`)
- **Modified**: nav, explore page, explore hero, explore barrel exports, API route, sitemap, i18n (EN+JP)

### Analytics Events
`build_territory_click`, `build_engage_card_click`, `build_form_submit`, `build_advisory_click`, `explore_filter_change`, `explore_to_build_click`

## ESL Lesson Generator (2026-03-06)

### Overview
Auto-generates supplemental ESL (English as a Second Language) content from course materials using Claude API, with TTS pronunciation audio via OpenAI. Designed for Japanese professionals learning AI skills while improving their English. Configurable per course — some bundle ESL free, others sell as Stripe add-on.

### Phase 1: Database + Types + Access (Foundation)
- [x] Migration `supabase/migrations/010_esl_schema.sql` — ALTER courses (5 ESL columns), 4 new tables (`esl_lessons`, `esl_audio`, `esl_progress`, `esl_purchases`), RLS policies, indexes
- [x] TypeScript types `lib/esl/types.ts` — VocabularyItem, GrammarPoint, CulturalNote, ComprehensionItem, ESLSettings, ESLLesson, ESLAudio, ESLProgress, ESLPurchase, ESLLessonWithAudio, WeekESLContext, ESLAccessResult
- [x] Zod validation schemas `lib/esl/schemas.ts` — validates Claude API JSON output
- [x] Access control `lib/esl/access.ts` — `checkESLAccess(userId, courseId)` (admin bypass → esl_included + enrollment → esl_purchases)
- [x] Queries `lib/esl/queries.ts` — getESLLessonForWeek, getESLLessonsForCourse, getESLProgress, getESLProgressForCourse

### Phase 2: Generation Pipeline (Core Value)
- [x] ESL generator `lib/esl/generator.ts` — Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`), specialized ESL prompt, Zod validation
- [x] TTS generator `lib/esl/tts.ts` — OpenAI TTS API (`tts-1`, `nova` voice, 0.9 speed), Supabase Storage upload, concurrency limiter (3 parallel)
- [x] `POST /api/esl/generate` — admin-only, accepts `{ courseId, weekIds? }`, background generation via `after()`
- [x] `GET /api/esl/[weekId]` — authenticated, checks ESL access, returns ESLLessonWithAudio
- [x] `POST /api/esl/[weekId]/publish` — admin-only, status → published
- [x] `POST /api/esl/audio/generate` — admin-only, background TTS via `after()`
- [x] `POST /api/esl/progress` — authenticated, upserts vocabulary_completed/comprehension_score/flashcard_known
- [x] `POST /api/admin/esl/update` — admin-only, saves manual edits to ESL content

### Phase 3: Student UI Components (10 new)
- [x] `AudioPlayButton` — inline play/pause using HTMLAudioElement, loading/playing/idle states
- [x] `VocabularyCard` — expandable card with term, IPA, translation, definition, usage sentences, audio, difficulty badge, "learned" toggle
- [x] `GrammarSpotlight` — collapsible grammar card with pattern, EN/JP explanation, examples with audio, common mistakes
- [x] `CulturalNoteCard` — collapsible card with category icon/color, bilingual content, practical tip
- [x] `ComprehensionCheck` — interactive quiz (multiple choice, fill-in-blank), progress indicator, score tracking
- [x] `ESLProgressBar` — horizontal bar showing vocab learned count + comprehension score
- [x] `FlashcardMode` — full-screen flip cards (EN↔JP), known/unknown marking, shuffle, progress tracking
- [x] `ESLPurchaseCard` — locked-state upsell CTA with bilingual copy, triggers Stripe checkout
- [x] `ESLLessonView` — container: progress bar → vocabulary + flashcard button → grammar → cultural notes → comprehension
- [x] `ESLTab` — week selector + data fetching + access check → renders ESLLessonView or ESLPurchaseCard
- [x] CourseHub integration — conditional ESL tab when `course.esl_enabled` (~10 lines changed)

### Phase 4: Admin Integration
- [x] `ESLAdminDashboard` — per-week status table (generating/review/published/failed/not started), Generate All/per-week actions
- [x] `ESLReviewPanel` — view/edit generated ESL content, Save Changes button
- [x] Admin ESL page `app/[locale]/admin/courses/[id]/esl/page.tsx` — server component with auth check
- [x] Wizard ESL settings in `WizardStepBasicInfo` — enable checkbox, vocab depth, grammar count, pricing (included vs add-on)
- [x] `createCourseFromParsedData` — passes ESL fields when inserting course

### Phase 5: Monetization (Stripe Add-on)
- [x] `POST /api/esl/purchase` — creates Stripe Checkout Session with `metadata.type = 'esl_addon'`
- [x] Webhook extension in `lib/stripe/webhooks.ts` — routes `esl_addon` checkouts to `handleESLPurchaseCompleted()`
- [x] i18n: full `esl` namespace (~50 keys each) in `messages/en.json` and `messages/ja.json`

### New File Count (ESL Lesson Generator)
- **7 lib modules** (`lib/esl/types.ts`, `schemas.ts`, `access.ts`, `queries.ts`, `generator.ts`, `tts.ts`)
- **8 API routes** (`app/api/esl/generate/`, `[weekId]/`, `[weekId]/publish/`, `audio/generate/`, `progress/`, `purchase/`, `app/api/admin/esl/update/`)
- **10 ESL components** (`components/esl/`)
- **2 admin components** (`components/admin/ESLAdminDashboard.tsx`, `ESLReviewPanel.tsx`)
- **1 admin page** (`app/[locale]/admin/courses/[id]/esl/page.tsx`)
- **1 SQL migration** (`supabase/migrations/010_esl_schema.sql`)
- **Modified**: `lib/courses/types.ts`, `components/learn/CourseHub.tsx`, `components/admin/wizard/WizardStepBasicInfo.tsx`, `lib/courses/actions.ts`, `lib/stripe/webhooks.ts`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/ja.json`

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript: zero errors (`tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Run migration against Supabase
- [ ] Create `esl-audio` storage bucket in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- [ ] End-to-end testing: admin generates → reviews → publishes → student accesses ESL → plays audio → uses flashcards → completes quiz

## Multi-Instructor Support

### Database
- [x] Migration `015_multi_instructor.sql` — `course_instructors` join table (course_id, instructor_id, role, sort_order)
- [x] `course_sessions.instructor_id` column for per-session instructor assignment
- [x] RLS policies: public read (published courses), admin full access
- [x] Data migration: existing `courses.instructor_id` → join table rows with `role = 'lead'`
- [x] Migration run on Supabase — verified successful

### Types & Data Layer
- [x] `CourseInstructor`, `CourseInstructorWithProfile`, `CourseInstructorRole` types (`lib/instructors/types.ts`)
- [x] `CourseSession` updated with `instructor_id` + resolved `instructor` field (`lib/courses/types.ts`)
- [x] `CourseWithCurriculum` updated with `instructors` array (backward-compat `instructor` kept as lead)
- [x] `getInstructorsForCourse(courseId)` query — fetches from join table, resolves profiles (`lib/instructors/queries.ts`)
- [x] `getAdminCourseById` and `getCourseWithCurriculum` — fetch multi-instructor data + session-level instructor resolution
- [x] Instructor course counts now query `course_instructors` table (not legacy `courses.instructor_id`)

### Server Actions
- [x] `addInstructorToCourse(courseId, instructorId, role?)` — insert into join table, first instructor auto-lead
- [x] `removeInstructorFromCourse(courseId, instructorId)` — delete + clear session assignments for that instructor
- [x] `updateCourseInstructorRole(courseInstructorId, role)` — change role (lead/instructor/guest)
- [x] `syncLegacyInstructorId()` helper — keeps `courses.instructor_id` in sync for backward compat
- [x] `updateCourseSession` — now accepts `instructor_id` for per-session assignment
- [x] `demoteToStudent` — checks `course_instructors` table for active course assignments

### Admin UI
- [x] `InstructorAssignControl` rewritten for multi-instructor — list with role badges (Lead/Instructor/Guest), role dropdown, add/remove
- [x] `SessionEditor` — instructor dropdown appears when course has 2+ instructors ("Default" + all course instructors)
- [x] `AdminCourseDetail` — wired with new props, Instructor(s) info field shows comma-separated names

### Public UI
- [x] Course detail page — renders multiple `InstructorCard` components with role labels (Lead Instructor, Guest Instructor)
- [x] Heading pluralizes: "Your Instructor" vs "Your Instructors"
- [x] Backward-compatible: falls back to single `InstructorCard` + legacy `instructor_name`

### i18n
- [x] EN: `instructors`, `lead_instructor`, `guest_instructor`
- [x] JP: `講師陣`, `主任講師`, `ゲスト講師`

### Syllabus PDF
- [x] `generate-pdf.ts` — instructor field now lists all instructor display names (comma-separated)

## Bonus Sessions for Courses

Ad-hoc bonus sessions (office hours, guest speakers, workshops, Q&A) that are not tied to weekly curriculum. Extends `course_sessions` with `is_bonus` flag approach — reuses existing infrastructure.

### Database
- [x] Migration `016_bonus_sessions.sql` — `is_bonus`, `bonus_type`, `description_en/jp` columns
- [x] `week_id` and `session_number` made nullable for bonus sessions
- [x] Check constraints: bonus sessions must have no week + must have a type; curriculum sessions must have a week + no type
- [x] Index on `(course_id, is_bonus, scheduled_at)` for efficient queries

### TypeScript Types
- [x] `BonusSessionType` union: `'office-hours' | 'guest-speaker' | 'workshop' | 'qa'`
- [x] `CourseSession` — `week_id` and `session_number` now nullable; added `is_bonus`, `bonus_type`, `description_en/jp`
- [x] `CourseWithCurriculum` — added `bonusSessions: CourseSession[]`

### Queries
- [x] `getCourseWithCurriculum` — filters `is_bonus = false` for curriculum; separate query for bonus sessions ordered by `scheduled_at`
- [x] `getAdminCourseById` — same separation; bonus sessions attached as `bonusSessions`
- [x] Instructor resolution applied to bonus sessions via existing instructor map

### Server Actions
- [x] `createBonusSession(courseId, data)` — insert with `is_bonus: true`, `week_id: null`
- [x] `updateBonusSession(sessionId, updates)` — all bonus session fields
- [x] `deleteBonusSession(sessionId)` — safety check: only deletes if `is_bonus = true`

### Admin UI
- [x] `BonusSessionEditor` — type dropdown, title EN/JP, description EN/JP, instructor dropdown, Zoom paste-parser, replay/transcript/slides URLs, date/time, duration, status, delete with confirmation
- [x] `AdminCourseDetail` — "Bonus Sessions" tab (after Curriculum, before Students) with count badge, "Add Bonus Session" button

### Public UI
- [x] `BonusSessionsSection` — renders on course detail page below curriculum
- [x] Cards with type badges (icon + color per type), title, description, instructor, date, duration, status
- [x] Enrollment gating: Zoom link hidden for non-enrolled, replay hidden until completed
- [x] Sorted: upcoming first, completed below, no-date last

### i18n
- [x] EN + JP keys under `learn.bonusSessions`: title, type labels, action labels, empty state

### Files Created/Modified
- **Created**: `supabase/migrations/016_bonus_sessions.sql`, `components/admin/BonusSessionEditor.tsx`, `components/learn/BonusSessionsSection.tsx`
- **Modified**: `lib/courses/types.ts`, `lib/courses/queries.ts`, `lib/courses/actions.ts`, `components/admin/AdminCourseDetail.tsx`, `components/learn/SessionCard.tsx`, `lib/syllabus/generate-pdf.ts`, `app/[locale]/learn/[slug]/page.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/ja.json`

### Verification
- [x] Production build: compiled successfully with zero type errors

## Freemium Course Sessions

Per-course "try before you buy" — the first N sessions of any course are freely accessible to logged-in users. Drives enrollment conversions by letting students sample real content before paying.

### Database
- [x] Migration `017_freemium_sessions.sql` — `free_preview_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` on `courses` table
- [x] No RLS changes needed — session metadata already public; content gating is at component level

### TypeScript Types
- [x] `Course` — added `free_preview_count: number`

### Utility Functions
- [x] `lib/courses/utils.ts` (new file) — `isSessionFree()` and `getFreeSessionIds()`
- [x] Pure functions: sort non-bonus sessions by `week_number ASC, session_number ASC`, first N are free
- [x] Bonus sessions excluded (always enrolled-only)

### Queries & Actions
- [x] No code changes needed — queries use `select('*')` which includes the new column; `updateCourse()` accepts `Record<string, unknown>`

### Public UI
- [x] `SessionCard` — new `isFree`, `isLoggedIn`, `isEnrolled` props; "Free Preview" badge, lock icon, login CTA, enroll CTA
- [x] `CurriculumAccordion` — "Free Preview" indicator on weeks containing free sessions
- [x] `WeekCard` — passes free session context to SessionCards
- [x] `StickyEnrollSidebar` — "First {N} session(s) free" marketing copy below price

### Admin UI
- [x] `AdminCourseDetail` overview tab — number input for "Free Preview Sessions" with save button

### Course Detail Page
- [x] Computes `freeSessionIds` via `getFreeSessionIds()`, passes to CurriculumAccordion and sidebar

### i18n
- [x] EN + JP keys under `learn.freemium`: freePreview, loginToAccess, enrollToUnlock, firstNFree, freePreviewCount, freePreviewHelper

### Access Control
- Enrolled: full access (unchanged)
- Logged in + free session: full access (replay, Zoom, slides, transcript)
- Logged in + paid session: metadata + lock icon + enroll CTA
- Not logged in + free session: metadata + login CTA
- Bonus sessions: always enrolled-only

### Files Created/Modified
- **Created**: `supabase/migrations/017_freemium_sessions.sql`, `lib/courses/utils.ts`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-26-freemium-sessions-design.md`
- **Modified**: `lib/courses/types.ts`, `components/learn/SessionCard.tsx`, `components/learn/CurriculumAccordion.tsx`, `components/learn/WeekCard.tsx`, `components/learn/StickyEnrollSidebar.tsx`, `components/admin/AdminCourseDetail.tsx`, `app/[locale]/learn/[slug]/page.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/ja.json`

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript: zero type errors from freemium changes
- [ ] Migration: apply `017_freemium_sessions.sql` to Supabase
- [ ] End-to-end: set `free_preview_count` on test course, verify all access tiers

## UserMenu: Popup → Persistent Inline Links

Replaced the avatar-button + portal dropdown pattern with persistent, always-visible navigation links rendered inline in the menu/sidebar.

### Changes
- [x] `UserMenu` refactored — removed popup/dropdown (portal, outside-click, escape-key, positioning). Now renders Dashboard, Admin, Sign Out as persistent inline links
- [x] New props: `compact` (icon-only mode for collapsed sidebar/navbar), `direction` (horizontal for top nav, vertical for sidebars), `onNavigate` (callback for closing mobile menu)
- [x] `StudentNav` — user links render persistently above theme/lang toggles, respects collapsed state
- [x] `AdminNav` — same persistent layout above theme/lang toggles
- [x] `MobileMenu` — passes `onNavigate={onClose}` so each link closes the drawer
- [x] `NavClient` — desktop top nav uses compact horizontal icon row

### Files Modified
- `components/layout/user-menu.tsx` (full rewrite — no more popup)
- `components/layout/mobile-menu.tsx` (onNavigate prop)
- `components/layout/nav-client.tsx` (compact + direction props)
- `components/learn/StudentNav.tsx` (new bottom layout)
- `components/admin/AdminNav.tsx` (new bottom layout)

## Survey Assignment — Pre-Course Surveys for Students

Token-based pre-course surveys optionally assigned when creating a student in the admin panel. Survey link is included in the welcome email (no login required). Responses are linked to the specific student for AI learning profile building, with pending/completed tracking in the admin UI.

### Database
- [x] Migration `022_surveys.sql` — `surveys` registry table (slug, title_en, title_jp, is_active), `survey_assignments` table (user_id, survey_id, token UUID, status, completed_at), token index
- [x] `survey_responses` — added nullable `user_id` and `assignment_id` columns (backward-compatible; anonymous submissions unchanged)
- [x] Migration `023_survey_summaries.sql` — `survey_summaries` table for AI-generated cohort analysis (survey_id, response_count, stats JSONB, summary_text, key_takeaways, tool_recommendations, instructor_notes, generated_at)
- [x] Seed: AI Essentials survey row in `surveys` table

### Backend
- [x] `lib/survey/actions.ts` — `validateSurveyToken(token)` server action: looks up assignment + survey + user via service role client, returns `{ userId, assignmentId, userName, surveySlug, status }` or null (graceful fallback to anonymous mode)
- [x] `lib/admin/actions.ts` — `assignSurvey(userId, surveyId)`: inserts `survey_assignments` row, returns `{ token, slug }`
- [x] `lib/admin/queries.ts` — `getActiveSurveys()`: fetches active surveys; `getStudentList()`: updated to include `survey_status` (most recent assignment per student)
- [x] `lib/admin/types.ts` — `ActiveSurvey` interface; `survey_status` added to `StudentListItem`

### Welcome Email
- [x] `lib/email/types.ts` — `courseTitle?` and `surveyUrl?` added to `StudentWelcomeEmailData`
- [x] `lib/email/send.ts` — `sendStudentWelcomeEmail()` fully rewritten: personalized greeting, conditional course block, password/dashboard CTA, link expiry note, conditional survey CTA, `help@honuvibe.com` support footer; bilingual (EN/JP)
- [x] `lib/students/actions.ts` — `sendStudentWelcomeEmailAction()` accepts optional `surveyUrl` and `courseTitle`

### Admin UI
- [x] `app/[locale]/admin/students/new/page.tsx` — fetches `activeSurveys` via `getActiveSurveys()` alongside courses
- [x] `components/admin/AddStudentFlow.tsx` — Step 2: "Assign Survey" dropdown; after save: calls `assignSurvey()`, constructs token URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL/survey/[slug]?token=[uuid]`), passes to welcome email; Step 3: survey confirmation line; retry/resend buttons include survey URL
- [x] `components/admin/AdminStudentList.tsx` — Survey column with `Pending` (amber) / `Completed` (teal) / `—` badges

### Survey Page
- [x] `app/[locale]/survey/ai-essentials/page.tsx` — thin server wrapper, reads `searchParams.token`, passes to client component
- [x] `app/[locale]/survey/ai-essentials/survey-form.tsx` (new) — client component; on mount calls `validateSurveyToken`; shows "already completed" screen if status=completed; pre-fills name from token; includes `assignmentId` in submit payload

### Submit Route
- [x] `app/api/survey/submit/route.ts` — accepts optional `assignmentId`; looks up `user_id` from `survey_assignments`; stores both on `survey_responses` insert; marks assignment `status=completed` + `completed_at` after successful insert; fires `regenerateSurveySummary` via `after()` in background

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript: zero errors
- [x] Production build: clean
- [ ] DB migrations applied (`supabase db push`)
- [ ] End-to-end: create student → assign survey → check email → submit survey → verify completion status

## Manual Student Add (Admin)

Allows admins to manually create or find students and optionally enroll them in a course, bypassing Stripe. Designed for students who pay through Vertice Society, in-person, or other offline methods.

### Database
- [x] Migration `020_enrollment_notes.sql` — adds `notes TEXT` nullable column to `enrollments` for audit trail

### Server Actions
- [x] `lib/students/actions.ts` — `createNewUserAndStudent()`: creates auth user via admin client, polls for `handle_new_user()` trigger row, rolls back on failure
- [x] `lib/students/actions.ts` — `sendStudentWelcomeEmailAction()`: generates recovery/magic link, sends bilingual welcome email, always fires admin notification

### Queries & Actions
- [x] `lib/admin/queries.ts` — `getActiveCourses()` returns courses with status `published` or `in-progress` for the enrollment picker
- [x] `lib/admin/actions.ts` — `manualEnroll()` updated: `requireAdmin()` guard added, `notes` field persisted, `skipEnrollmentEmail` param to prevent double-email

### Email
- [x] `lib/email/types.ts` — `StudentWelcomeEmailData` interface
- [x] `lib/email/send.ts` — `sendStudentWelcomeEmail()` (bilingual, new/existing account variants) + `sendStudentWelcomeAdminNotification()`

### UI
- [x] `components/admin/AddStudentFlow.tsx` — 3-step wizard (Search → Enroll → Done): email search, existing user card or create-new form, course picker, notes field, welcome email toggle with EN/JP locale selector, post-completion email status with resend option
- [x] `app/[locale]/admin/students/new/page.tsx` — server page wrapper fetching active courses
- [x] `app/[locale]/admin/students/page.tsx` — "Add Student" button added to page header

### Files Created/Modified
- **Created**: `supabase/migrations/020_enrollment_notes.sql`, `lib/students/actions.ts`, `components/admin/AddStudentFlow.tsx`, `app/[locale]/admin/students/new/page.tsx`
- **Modified**: `lib/admin/actions.ts`, `lib/admin/queries.ts`, `lib/email/types.ts`, `lib/email/send.ts`, `app/[locale]/admin/students/page.tsx`

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript: zero type errors
- [x] Production build: compiled successfully
- [ ] Migration: apply `020_enrollment_notes.sql` to Supabase

## AI Cohort Survey Summary (Admin)

Auto-generated AI panel at the top of `/admin/surveys` showing cohort-level insights after each submission. Triggered fire-and-forget via Next.js `after()`. Designed to help instructors understand the cohort's background, goals, and tool usage before the course begins.

### Database
- [x] Migration `023_survey_summaries.sql` — `survey_summaries` table: `survey_id` FK to `surveys`, `response_count`, `stats JSONB`, `summary_text`, `key_takeaways TEXT[]`, `tool_recommendations`, `instructor_notes`, `generated_at` (depends on migration 022 from survey-assignment spec)

### Background Job
- [x] `lib/survey/summarize.ts` — `regenerateSurveySummary(courseSlug)`:
  - Looks up `survey_id` from `surveys` table by slug (graceful early return if table missing)
  - Fetches all `survey_responses` for the course slug; aggregates stats across 5 fields
  - Calls Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) with anonymized data — no PII sent
  - Parses JSON response with strict type guard; upserts `survey_summaries` on conflict
  - 20s AbortSignal timeout; full try/catch — never throws (safe for `after()`)

### API Route
- [x] `app/api/survey/submit/route.ts` — `after(() => regenerateSurveySummary('ai-essentials'))` fires after successful insert; does not block the 200 response

### UI
- [x] `components/admin/SurveySummaryPanel.tsx` — server component: null state placeholder, or populated panel with stat chips, key takeaways list, narrative summary, teal AI tool callout, gold instructor notes callout, generation timestamp footer
- [x] `app/[locale]/admin/surveys/page.tsx` — fetches summary via `surveys!inner(slug)` join; renders `<SurveySummaryPanel>` above `<AdminSurveyList>`; try/catch handles missing `surveys` table gracefully

### Files Created/Modified
- **Created**: `supabase/migrations/023_survey_summaries.sql`, `lib/survey/summarize.ts`, `components/admin/SurveySummaryPanel.tsx`
- **Modified**: `app/api/survey/submit/route.ts`, `app/[locale]/admin/surveys/page.tsx`

### Verification
- [x] TypeScript: zero type errors
- [x] Production build: compiled successfully
- [ ] Migrations: apply 022 (survey-assignment spec) then 023 to Supabase
- [ ] End-to-end: submit survey, verify `survey_summaries` row appears within seconds
- [ ] Admin panel: confirm panel renders at `/admin/surveys`
